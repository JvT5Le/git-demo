Jenny, Jenny, who can I turn to?
You give me somethin' I can hold on to
I know you think I'm like the others before
Who saw your name and number on the wall

Jenny, I got your number
I need to make you mine
Jenny, don't change your number

867-5309
867-5309
867-5309
867-5309

Jenny, Jenny, you're the girl for me
Oh, you don't know me, but you make me so happy
I tried to call you before, but I lost my nerve
I tried my imagination, but I was disturbed
